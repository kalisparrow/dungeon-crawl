# dungeon-crawl

Dungeon crawl is a text adventure game where you play as a hero traversing through a dungeon. You begin in front of three doors, each leading to harder foes as you progress. Make choices on which weapons to use and when to heal in order to beat the enemies that reside within.

Will you emerge as the victor? Or will you be doomed to forever wander the dungeon?





-- Future plans --

In the future, we plan to implement this text adventure on its own official web page for a more complete and immersive experience!
