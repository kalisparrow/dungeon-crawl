# dungeon-crawl

Dungeon Crawl is a text adventure game, with turn-based combat where you play as a hero traversing through a dungeon. You begin in front of three doors, each leading to harder foes as you progress. Make choices on which weapons to use and when to heal in order to beat the enemies that reside within.

Will you emerge as the victor? Or will you be doomed to forever wander the dungeon?

#basics-of-combat
The game uses user input to determine whether the user wants to attack using a sword or bow, or heal themselves with one of the three healing potions provided in each fight.
The game determines the strength of the user and enemy attacks that are chosen each turn, with both having a chance to miss completely. The sword has a low penalty on weak hits, and a low raise on heavy hits. The bow has a high penalty for weak hits, and a high raise on heavy hits. The bow is the more risk, more reward weapon to use. But dont forget, any atttack can miss! When either the user or enemy has a health of 0, the fight is over. 





-- Future plans --

In the future, we plan to implement this text adventure on its own official web page for a more complete and immersive experience!
